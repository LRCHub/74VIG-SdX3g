[00:14.99] Everyone makes mistakes
[00:17.67] I've had more than my share
[00:20.31] But it's okay 'cause I'm gonna repair it
[00:25.43] They say there are no retakes
[00:28.41] But I just don't agree, no, this show
[00:32.31] Is of my own making
[00:36.78] Take it back to the start
[00:42.10] I've had a change of heart
[00:47.55] I know we can make it better than it ever was
[00:50.35] I know we can make it better
[00:53.05] I know we can make it better than it ever was
[00:55.95] I know we can make it better
[01:10.45] 
[01:20.38] I know there's things to change
[01:23.12] The path that I could choose is loose and
[01:27.12] I must find a new one
[01:31.03] Our fates are not yet written
[01:34.08] I will take the warning, choose a
[01:38.03] Way that's less destructive
[01:41.30] Yeah, I know
[01:43.22] We look bad
[01:44.53] But we have only seen one path
[01:47.18] Can't you see?
[01:48.67] We are free
[01:50.05] To choose our destiny
[01:52.69] And be the way we want to be
[01:56.73] A second chance, you just need to believe
[01:58.53] Believe, Believe, Believe, Believe
[02:07.56] Believe, Believe, Believe, Believe
[02:12.95] Believe, Believe, Believe, Believe
[02:18.53] Believe, Believe, Believe, Believe
[02:21.77] Take it back to the start
[02:27.26] I've had a change of heart
[02:32.68] I know we can make it better than it ever was
[02:35.36] I know we can make it better
[02:38.14] I know we can make it better than it ever was
[02:40.79] I know we can make it better
[02:43.52] I know we can make it better than it ever was
[02:46.18] I know we can make it better
[02:49.06] I know we can make it better than it ever was
[02:51.74] I know we can make it better
